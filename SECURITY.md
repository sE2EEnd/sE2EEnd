# Security Policy

## Our Security Philosophy

As an E2EE solution, our priority is the zero-knowledge principle. We consider the following as high-priority vulnerabilities :
* weaknesses in the client-side key generation or exchange.
* authentication bypass involving our Keycloak integration.
* any flaw allowing the server to access unencrypted file data.

## Reporting Vulnerability

The sE2EEnd team and community take security bugs in the software seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/sE2EEnd/sE2EEnd/security/advisories/new) tab.
